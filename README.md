## Register Number: 24900295
## Name: Karthik ganesh.G
## Problem Title
Development of e-Portal for facilitating Case Management Hearing of various types of cases
## Problem Description
Case Management Hearing, known as a Pre-Trial Conference" in other jurisdictions". This application is used for managing case files since filing to disposal and to complete all its related processes. The CMS keeps the records of all the cases filed in Delhi High Court. The system has following features: Filing of Case, Caveat matching, Allocation of case, Daily Case Proceedings, Notice Generation, Case Transfer, Case Status Search, Report, etc.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Law and Justice

## Idea
Develop an e-Portal to streamline the management of case files and proceedings from initial filing to final disposal. The portal aims to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accessibility in the judicial process by digitizing and automating various stages of Case Management Hearings (CMH), including filing, allocation, proceedings, and reporting.

Frontend:
```
User Interface for different stakeholders (Judges, Lawyers, Court Clerks)
Forms for filing cases, viewing case status, and generating reports
Backend:
Case Management System (CMS) handling core functionalities like case filing, allocation, proceedings, and notice generation
Database storing all case-related information, user data, and logs
Business Logic Layer managing workflows such as case allocation and caveat matching
APIs:
RESTful APIs to enable communication between frontend and backend
Integration APIs for connecting with external systems (e.g., government databases)
Database:
Relational Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for structured data storage
Security:
Authentication & Authorization mechanisms (OAuth, JWT)
Data encryption (TLS/SSL) to ensure secure data transmission
Role-based access control to restrict access based on user roles
```

## Use Cases
```
Filing of Cases:
Lawyers can file cases online, and the system will generate a unique case ID.
Caveat Matching:
Automatically match caveats with relevant cases to notify the concerned parties.
Case Allocation:
Automate or manually allocate cases to judges based on criteria such as availability and case type.
Daily Case Proceedings:
Record and update the daily proceedings of cases in real-time.
Notice Generation:
Automatically generate notices for the parties involved in a case.
Case Transfer:
Facilitate the seamless transfer of cases between different courts or judges.
Case Status Search:
Provide a search interface to check the status of a case using various filters.
Reporting:
Generate and export reports on case statistics, pendency, and disposal rates.
```

## Technology Stack

```
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React.js, Angular, or Vue.js)
UI frameworks like Bootstrap or Material UI for responsive design
Backend:
Node.js with Express or Java with Spring Boot for server-side logic
RESTful API services for interaction between frontend and backend
Database:
